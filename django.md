# Models
## Basic example
```python
from django.db import models

class Customer(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    address = models.TextField()
    email = models.EmailField()
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

## Available relationships

* `ForeignKey` A many-to-one relationship. Requires two positional arguments: the class to which the model is related and the `on_delete` option. Common values for `on_delete` are `CASCADE` and `SET_NULL`, `SET_NULL` requires `null=True`.

* `ManyToManyField` A many-to-many relationship. Requires a positional argument: the class to which the model is related, which works exactly the same as it does for `ForeignKey`, including recursive and lazy relationships.
